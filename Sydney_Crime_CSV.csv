"^    For murder and manslaughter, the data are counts of recorded victims, not criminal incidents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
^^  The trend test used was a two-tailed Kendall’s rank-order correlation test with a 0.05 level of significance . ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
      For the 24-month trend the annual percentage change is provided if the trend was significant. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
      For the 60-month trend the average annual percentage change is provided if the trend was significant. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*    Ranks and rates are only calculated for Local Government Areas (LGAs) with populations of 3000 people or more (n = 120).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
      Sydney LGA is excluded from the rankings because the resident population does not reflect the number of people present each day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
      Ranks and rates are not calculated for the ‘In Custody’ category,,      ,,,,,,,,,,,,
      Rates are only calculated for the major offences. Ranks are not calculated for murder due to the low number of recorded victims per LGA. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
      The robbery and sex offence categories are combined because the numbers are too small within the individual categories to calculate reliable rate estimates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**   Trend information is not calculated (nc) if at least one 12-month period in the selected timeframe had less than 20 incidents. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
